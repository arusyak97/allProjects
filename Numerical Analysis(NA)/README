Project: Google PageRank Algorithm

Short Description:
  Do you know how Google ranks pages? Simple - by using Linear Algebra, and, in particular, matrix eigenvalues.
  Of course, not of a small-order matrix. The method is called Google PageRank, and is developed by Google
  founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page while they were graduate students at Stanford. At that time, Brin and
  Page were 23 and 24 years old, respectively, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank.
  There are many other uses of the PageRank Algorithm, such as in bibliometrics, social
  and information network analysis, Twitter, journal citation ranking, and for quantifying
  the scientific impact of researchers.

The Project:
  The aim of the Project will be to develop the simple model for PageRank Algorithm. Mathematically,
  problems will reduce to numerical eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation, i.e., a solution of a large
  system of linear equations, and will use some probabilistic methods.
