lol"
18,". Looks awesome. i cannot wait to see wat  has created and hopefully bring Arthur Curry   the god damn respect  he deserves, As he is one bad ass character. And finally get to see Mera  in full swing action."
19,"I’ve never entirely felt this worked (perhaps because in the UK the closest ‘kid turns into superhero’ was Bananaman); however, Jason Momoa’s chest/charisma aside, I’m more convinced of this as a potential for DC than Aquaman. "
20,"I added a video to a  playlist  AQUAMAN vs SHAZAM! // LIVE"
21,"Now there's an Aquaman trailer too?!! What. Is. Happening???? "
22,"The new Aquaman movie looks amazing <U+0001F60D> "
23," If Glass was here i would have voted that. But tho aquaman and shazam was good, something about them looked not right, maybe CGI, i dont know. But i voted Godzilla cos its a great monster and the movie is gonna b so good"
24,"The Shazam trailer wasn't really my cup of tea (still was a funny trailer) but Aquaman was <U+0001F525><U+0001F525> so excited to see that movie especially bcs Jason Momoa is an amazing actor"

29,"Aquaman... ehhh. 
1. that is not a trident <U+0001F612>
2. The dialogue sounds shitty in the trailer. 
3. Amber Heards wig is very yes &amp; no, like its 2018, we have figured out wig technology. Beyonce’s ppl figured out wig technology a decade ago, I shouldnt be so distracted by a damn wig."

32,"I liked a  video  Aquaman - Official Trailer 1"
33," I may be more into Aquaman after I see Justice League, doesn’t do much for me from that trailer"
34,"Aquaman is even more of a bro in his solo movie than he was in 'Justice League'  "
35,"I thought I heard Aquaman was going to go for a horror aesthetic for its movie. That doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. Probably for the best, but I would have been interested in how that’d be done <U+0001F602>"
36,"I liked a  video  AQUAMAN OFFICIAL TRAILER"
37,"Shazam and Aquaman seem really good from the trailers. I mean we actually have color! This might just revive DC"
38,"I guess I don't get it. I thought the AQUAMAN trailer was OUTSTANDING. But of course butt hurt bitches are already ""meh-ing"" it and calling it ugly, loud, and a miss. WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?? I think it looks fun and pretty damn BEAUTIFUL --esp Atlantis. WTF?!?"
39,"Godzilla: King of Monsters, Aquaman and Shazam trailer!! can't wait for Captain Marvel trailer too!!"
40,"  Man of Steel was good. BvS was ok but had some issues, which the extended cut helped a bit. JL wasn't horrible but didn't live up to most expectations.  was a very solid film.  looks very promising. Almost has a Thor feel to it, which I think is a good thing."
41," What about Aquaman???"
42," I love Marvel movies, but I really really want DC to do well. Justice League was not as good as, say Infinity War, but it's far better than BvS was. I don't want to hate them, I love DC heroes. I am very optimistic for Aquaman, and I hope this makes people take Aquaman seriously."
43," is looking pretty great. They seem to be taking the character seriously, and if they do that, this movie could be great."
44,"After what seems like years  first trailer is here     

The bar is set so low with  this should at the very least be a fun watch

Glass:
Can’t wait. Awesome trailer.

Godzilla - King of Monsters:
Looks WAY better than the last one for sure, looks sweet.

Fantastic Beasts 2:
Neat. Kay.

Shazam:
Pleasant surprise. Looks hilarious!

Aquaman:
Jesus, slow tf down."
566,"For the record,  (while some CGI is definitely obvious) looks visually creative and I trust Wan as a director, but there is ZERO pacing in that trailer. The whole thing goes by so quickly you cannot process a single shot."
567,"I liked a  video  Aquaman - Official Trailer 1"
568,"All these trailers I just watch Aquaman Shazam fantastic breasts the gifted"
569,"So  and  look great. 

MCU fans: These should be fun to watch,  can't wait! 

DCEU fans: tHeY aRe AbaNdOnInG tHeY sNyDeR lOoK iN fAvOr oF tHe JL lOoK. reLeAsE tHE sNyDeR cUt
