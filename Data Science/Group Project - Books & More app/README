Short Description:
  The "Books & More" application aims to provide statistical information, qualitative and
  quantitative analysis targeted not only towards people with a desire to find an interesting book
  but also towards book analysts looking for reliable and accurate information. The application
  itself is a source of information and data collection about the variety of books and authors stored
  within its library.
