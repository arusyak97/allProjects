Short Description:
  This paper discusses time series forecasting, specifically, stock price prediction using neural
  networks. We come up with two neural network architectural solutions, one being convolutional neural
  networks and another being LSTM. In the end, we present the comparison of results, suggest future plans
  and provides Python implementations.
