Group Project Topic:
  American Options Pricing

Team: Sona Ghevondyan, Arusyak Hakobyan

Short Description:
  Options are financial contracts to buy or sell an asset (e.g., stock) at
  some time spot in the future according to the contract details, see https://en.wikipedia.
  org/wiki/Option_(finance). Option Pricing models are developed to calculate the value
  of options at any time prior to maturity. And since these contracts are for the delivery of
  the underlying asset in the future, one needs to construct a suitable model for the price of
  that underlying asset.
  American Options differ from the European Options by allowing to be executed any
  time before the maturity, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style. The Mathematical
  model for the pricing of American Options reduces to a so-called Obstacle problem,
  which is a Partial Differential Equation in an unknown domain, and an additional information
  is known to construct the domain and solution simultaneously. Unfortunately, no
  analytic solution is known for this problem, so one uses Numerical Analysis to calculate
  the price.
  The aim of the Project will be to study Obstacle Problems, and to solve the American
  Option Pricing problem by numerical methods.
